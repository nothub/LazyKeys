# Lazy Keys

Automated key-pressing for enhanced afk farming efficiency.
This mod allows for some **player actions** to be **toggled on or off** with a keypress,
thus allowing users to e.g. **spam** the "use" **action** and **tab out** of the game.

This is especially useful in environments, where F3+T crashes the vanilla client
(e.g. mod-packs with tons of textures).
