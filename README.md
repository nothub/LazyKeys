# LazyKeys

This mod allows for some **player actions** to be **toggled on or off** with a keypress,
thus allowing users to e.g. **spam** the "use" **action** and **tab out** of the game.

This is especially useful in environments, where F3+T crashes the vanilla client
(e.g. mod-packs with tons of textures).

## Keybinds

| Player Action | Toggle Bind |
|---------------|-------------|
| Use/Place     | Numpad 2    |
| Sneak         | Numpad 3    |
| Attack/Break  | -           |
| Sprint        | -           |
| Jump          | -           |
